        <p>
            I was raised in the south central region of Pennsylvania which is Amish country.
            Being brought up on a farm, all we built was from scratch, hand-made. With this
            background, I learned my woodworking skills early in life.

            I started relief carving in the 80â€™s which I pursued for ten years. After moving to
            Texas, I encountered pieces of woodwork made from mesquite. I was hooked! I
            have worked with a wide variety of wood (oak, basswood, butternut, teak, and
            walnut) but have never seen a wood that matches the beauty of mesquite.
